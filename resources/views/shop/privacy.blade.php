                    <h4>Safety and Security Tips
Protect your passwords.</h4>
                    <p>If using a public computer or terminal, always log out when you complete an online session. Keep your passwords private. Remember, anybody who knows your password may access your account. When creating a valid password, use letters and numbers only and it should be 6-15 characters long. –A combination of letters and numbers is best. Do not use dictionary words, your name, e-mail address, or other personal information that can be easily obtained. It is also recommended that you frequently change your password. Avoid using the same password for multiple online accounts. Be wary of unsolicited e-mail and telephone contacts. Unity Mall Inc. Inc. will never e-mail or call a customer and ask that they disclose or verify their unitymall.in password, credit card, or banking account number. Such information should only be submitted on the web page forms, when completing an order on unitymall.in or when making updates to Your Account areas and never on phone or e-mail to us. If you receive a suspicious e-mail with a link to update your account information, do not click on the link--instead go directly to https://www.unitymall.in and then to your account. If you are contacted by, or receive an unsolicited e-mail from an unknown entity impersonating as unitymall.in or any of its sister concerns or associates, and are asked to confirm or provide your password or personal or banking information, simply disregard the request and report the incident to unitymall.in for investigation. Customers should always carefully review order and shipment confirmation e-mails to ensure that they are legitimate and have been sent by unitymall.in. To do this, simply cross-reference confirmation e-mails with the transaction history found in your account area. If you receive shipment confirmation e-mail for a transaction you have not done, report the incident to unitymall.in A word of caution is that never disclose any confidential information such as password in any communication with us or with any of our employee. Unity Mall Inc. Inc. will never ask for such information over e-mails or phone. If you receive an e-mail asking for personal details such as password never respond to it. A phishing email will normally have a tone of urgency – like "Your account will be temporarily suspended" and therefore please "Login to keep your account active." Please remember Unity Mall Inc. Inc. will NEVER send such emails to its customers. If you are doubtful about the credibility of the email, please DO NOT click on any link provided in the email. This may trigger malicious codes being installed on your PC. You must report the incident to unitymall.in If you receive a suspected spoofed unitymall.in e-mail, or discover a fake unitymall.in website, please report the incident to unitymall.in.</p>
